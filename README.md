Camino is a minimal, distraction-free habit tracker designed to help you stay consistent and focused.
It securely syncs your data using Google Sign-In, so your habits are always up to date across devices.

I'm working on providing an app version of camino, but for now you can visit the site at: [https://camino.rknastenka.com](https://camino.rknastenka.com)

If you have ideas, suggestions, or just want to share your experience, feel free to [reach out](mailto:caminotracker@gmail.com).

Contributions and feedback are always welcome.
